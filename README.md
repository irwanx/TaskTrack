# To-Do List App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built with React. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Users can also sort tasks based on priority and creation date, as well as search for specific tasks. The application supports both light and dark modes.

## Tech Stack

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: The main programming language used for app development.
- HTML: Used for application structure.
- Tailwind CSS: Used for styling.
- LocalStorage: Local storage of task data on the user's browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a name, description, due date, and priority level.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Complete Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Search Tasks**: Users can search for tasks by name or description.
- **Sort Tasks**: Users can sort tasks by priority (high to low or low to high) and by creation date (newest first or oldest first).
- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage so that they persist across page reloads.
